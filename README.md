# [ChatGPT And Generative AI Innovations Are Creating Sustainability Havoc](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cindygordon/2024/03/12/chatgpt-and-generative-ai-innovations-are-creating-sustainability-havoc/)

I found this article interesting because although various engineering projects, from bridges to tunnels, are constantly put under public scrutiny for their negative environmental impact, I feel that software and AI in particular are comparatively less scrutinized because of their less perceptible impacts on the environment. I wonder whether the pushback against ChatGPT and other similar AI models will grow as AI assistants become a bigger and bigger part of people's lives.

Following up on this, I wonder whether it will be a priority of companies creating AI assistants to make the models more power efficient and environmentally friendly, or if they will largely forego these aspects of the chatbots to prioritize other aspects.
