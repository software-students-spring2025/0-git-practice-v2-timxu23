# [ChatGPT And Generative AI Innovations Are Creating Sustainability Havoc](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cindygordon/2024/03/12/chatgpt-and-generative-ai-innovations-are-creating-sustainability-havoc/)

I found this article interesting because although various engineering projects, from bridges to tunnels, are constantly put under public scrutiny for their negative environmental impact, I feel that software and AI in particular are comparatively less scrutinized because of their less perceptible impacts on the environment. I wonder whether the pushback against ChatGPT and other similar AI models will grow as AI assistants become a bigger and bigger part of people's lives.
